# Random Tiles Script for Aseprite v1.2.10+

Applies a random selection of tiles from the active layer's tileset, applying the scale of the active sprite.

Inspired by https://github.com/aseprite/Aseprite-Script-Examples's Random Pixels script.

1. Open the [user script folder](https://community.aseprite.org/t/locate-user-scripts-folder/2170).
2. Download `RandomTiles.lua` to the folder above.
3. Create a new layer with an active tileset.
4. Run the script from File > Scripts > RandomTiles.lua.
